# Sunrise
Sunrise is a multiplayer game actively being worked on by me and the team at WushR00M Studios.

## Getting Started
To open the project file, launch GameMaker and import the downloaded resources file. You can then compile Sunrise by clicking the "Play" / "Test" button.

## Contributing
If you would like to contribute to the development of Sunrise as in fixing a bug, improving a feature, or adding a brand new feature, you can follow these steps:
1. Fork the Repo -> https://www.github.com/WushR00M/Sunrise/fork
2. Create a branch -> ```git checkout -b branch_name```
3. Commit your changes -> ```git commit -am description```
4. Push the change to the branch -> ```git push origin change_name```
5. Submit a pull request

If you're adding a screen that requires any new resources (sprites, menus, rooms, etc.), you must provide those resources or your pull request will be denied instantly. All scripts will be throughly checked for backdoors, secrets, and more.
