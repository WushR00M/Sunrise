# Sunrise
Sunrise is a multiplayer game actively being worked on by me and the team at WushR00M Studios. Once the game is complete, we'll begin posting the source code for the official 1.0 (with all online features stripped of course).

# FAQ
## Will you release the source code for future versions, like 1.1, 1.2, etc?
Yes! We have plans for that, of course, the source code edition will take much longer as stripping away online features from a game that's supposed to be played online is difficult, so don't expect the source code to come out as soon as a new version releases every time.

## When will the game release?
Hopefully some time in 2024, we've been working since 2020 and we want this to be the best game possible!

## What platforms will it be on?
This source code will be compatiable to build for Windows, Linux distros, Android, and PlayStation 4 natively as the game is built for these devices.
